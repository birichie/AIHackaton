## Introduction
This is a disign that returns ideal diet that meets nutrition requirements at lowest environment cost i.e lowest CO2 emission

Mapped the best match in the Shrt_Desc column of the attached ABBREV to find the 14 products using R programming language instead of the manual approach

## Step 1
Understanding the predicting environment 
Get the 14 best mapped products from the ABBREV dataset average CO2 emission

## Step 2
The products were filtered based on nutrient. This is needed to get the ideal nutrient plan 

## Step 3
We select the products plus the CO2 as the input variables
Then, we run a combination of their CO2 emission

## Step 4
We filter for the product with the lowest CO2 emission to get minimum environmental cost 

##Step 5 - Not Implemented
Carried out the model prediction
